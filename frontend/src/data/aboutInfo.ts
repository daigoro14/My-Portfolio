        description: `I studied "Webb Developer Full-Stack Open Source" at Nackademin in Stockholm, Sweden. I was highly impressed by the quality of this course but also with the patience of the instructors. 
        
        The teachers, who were experienced professionals from the industry, provided the most up-to-date knowledge available in the market.

        Through engaging examples, clear explanations, and hands-on exercises, I gained a solid understanding of the fundamentals required to work as a developer and developed the mindset of a developer. I've done a lot of studying on my own as well, plus been fortunate to have more experienced developers in my presence to guide and mentor me.` ,

        description: `I'm a highly open minded and optimistic guy which has led me to explore a lot of different activities. Over the years, I have tried and pursued various interests, including skateboarding, music producing, language learning, gardening, and last but certainly not least, programming. 
        
        I am fluent in both Swedish and English, and thanks to my interest in languages I've acquired years of experience in various languages, including Portuguese, Lingala, Mandarin, French, and Tagalog.

        Each one of my hobbies has taught me valuable lessons that have come in handy in different occasions throughtout my life. Beside my hobbies I also enjoy spending time with family and friends.`,
